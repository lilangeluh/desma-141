    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
      Since 2015, my dad and I have spent much of our time living in different time zones. Even with the jet lag and the
      challenges of work schedules, he used to visit me in the United States every month. But after the pandemic,
      flights between China and the U.S. became far less frequent. Now, he can only make the trip every two or three
      months, and each visit lasts just about two weeks. Like many families separated by distance, we’ve had to find
      ways to stay connected despite being thousands of miles apart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past decade, I’ve deeply missed spending time with both my parents together. My dad often talks about how
      he wishes he’d had more time to watch me grow up. This sense of missed moments is something we both feel keenly.
      Given the time difference between Asia and the United States, we usually have just a brief window—five or six
      hours each day—when our waking hours overlap and we can hop on a call.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is an exploration on how our lives play out in parallel on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean.
      It’s a reflection of time, distance, and the connections that endure despite these separations. By visualizing our
      daily rhythms and moments that intersect, I hope to create something that not only captures our story, but also
      resonates with others who’ve experienced the challenge of staying close across time zones.
