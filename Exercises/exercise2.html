            <h2>The Art of Pickled Cucumbers</h2>
            
            <p class="intro">
                A pickled cucumber, commonly known as a pickle, is a cucumber that has been pickled in brine, vinegar, 
                or another solution and left to ferment for a period of time. This process creates a distinctively tangy 
                and flavorful food that has been enjoyed for thousands of years.
            </p>

            <h3>Origins & History</h3>
            <p>
                The process of pickling cucumbers dates back to ancient Mesopotamia around 2400 BCE. Pickles have been 
                referenced throughout history, from the writings of Aristotle to the voyages of Columbus, where they were 
                used to prevent scurvy.
            </p>

            <h3>Pickling Process</h3>
            <p class="highlight">
                Pickles are made using lactic acid fermentation or vinegar curing. <u>Fermented pickles</u> develop a more 
                complex, tangy flavor, while vinegar pickles have a sharper, acidic taste.
            </p>
